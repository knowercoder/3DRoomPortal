The other room is shown in the portal using the fake interior mapping. For more details on fake interior mapping, refer my [Basic Interior map repo](https://github.com/knowercoder/BasicInteriorMap). 

## Usage
in the shader property "CubeTex", you have assign a texture array of the room you want to render. The texture array is of 1 row and 6 columns
